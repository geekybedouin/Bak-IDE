Offers a graphical UI implemented in JAVA programming language based on the \"Khwarizmi Baby C Compiler\" - (kbcc) which is a single-pass compiler implemented in \"x86/GAS Syntax Assembly\" and \"C language\".The Kbcc is also a part of the Meow project and is also a free-software\" The compiler aims to transfer c code into a target machine code/executable program, with a report showing the details of each compiler phase. compatible with GNU/Linux x86 machines.\r\n\r\n=================\r\n Project License\r\n=================\r\n\r\n    Meow is a minimized IDE and a single pass compiler\r\n    Copyright (C) 2014  'Umar A.Abu Bakr\r\n\r\n    Meow is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, version 3 of the License.\r\n\r\n    Meow is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The Khwarizmi Baby C Compiler is a single-pass baby compiler based on a recursive descent parser.The Meow uses the \"Educational Release\" of the compiler, which doesn't do neither type-checking nor memory manipulation and allocation, because it's only set to let students demonstrate how a compiler works.\r\n\r\n\r\n  System Specs\r\n=================\r\n* GNU/linux x86 machine\r\n* gcc, g++ and build-utils installed\r\n\r\n===================\r\n  How to Install \r\n===================\r\n* In terminal, grant executing permissions to the configuration file (config) \r\n`sudo chmod a+x /absolute/path/to/config`\r\n* Run the config file in terminal \r\n`./absolute/path/to/config` \r\n\r\n=================\r\n   How to run \r\n=================\r\n* if you want to run the meow GUI\r\n  -in a bash, ksh or csh: simply type \"meow\"\r\n\r\n* if you want to run the kbcc only\r\n  -in a bash, ksh: [lexical /par1/ /par2/ /par3/]\r\n      -[par1]: absolute/path/to/source.cpp\r\n      -[par2]: absolute/path/to/temp.c **VERY IMPORTANT** --> this is used as the output of the preprocesser which eleminates comments\r\n      -[par3]: absolute/path/to/symbol-table.cpp\r\n\r\n====================\r\n Source Compilation\r\n====================\r\n\r\n* LEXICAL\r\n\r\n  the lexical analyser is written in two languages - c & x86/gas Assembly - and then generated all to a utilized gas assembly code through g++, if you want to assemble the code you can type - \r\n `as /absolute/path/to/parser.s`\r\n\r\n* meow IDE\r\n\r\n  use any IDE to compile the code\r\n\r\n======================\r\n Project Contribution\r\n======================\r\n\r\n\r\n the meow-IDE is listed under the GNU GPLv3 license which make it tottaly free-software, if you really want to add to the project be a contributer to our project on github: https://github.com/geekybedouin/Meow\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
