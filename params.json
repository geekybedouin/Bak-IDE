{"name":"Bak IDE","tagline":"The Educational IDE","body":"===================\r\n About the Project\r\n===================\r\n\r\n A free-software minimized educational IDE developed by 'Umar A.Abu Bakr - An-Najah National University | Computer Science student - 2014. Offers a graphical UI implemented in JAVA programming language based on the \"Khwarizmi Baby C Compiler\" - (kbcc) which is implemented in \"x86/GAS Syntax Assembly\". The compiler aims to transfer c code into a target machine code/executable program, with a report showing the details of each compiler phase. compatible with GNU/Linux x86 machines.\r\n\r\n=================\r\n  System Specs\r\n=================\r\n* JDK (Java Development Kit) 7.51 or higher\r\n* GNU/linux x86 machine\r\n* gcc, g++ and build-utils installed\r\n\r\n===================\r\n  How to Install \r\n===================\r\n* In terminal, grant executing permissions to the configuration file (config) [sudo chmod a+x /absolute/path/to/config]\r\n* Run the config file in terminal [./absolute/path/to/config] \r\n\r\n=================\r\n   How to run \r\n=================\r\n* if you want to run the Bak GUI\r\n  -in a bash, ksh or csh: [/absolute/path/to/java -jar /absolute/path/to/Bak.Jar]\r\n\r\n* if you want to run the kbcc only\r\n  -in a bash, ksh: [lexical /par1/ /par2/ /par3/]\r\n      -[par1]: absolute/path/to/source.cpp\r\n      -[par2]: absolute/path/to/temp.c **VERY IMPORTANT** --> this is used as the output of the preprocesser which eleminates comments\r\n      -[par3]: absolute/path/to/symbol-table.cpp\r\n\r\n====================\r\n Source Compilation\r\n====================\r\n\r\n* LEXICAL\r\n\r\n  the lexical analyser is written in two languages - c & x86/gas Assembly - and then generated all to a utilized gas assembly code through g++, if you want to assemble the code you can type -  [as /absolute/path/to/lexical.s] - in  terminal\r\n\r\n* Bak IDE\r\n\r\n  use any IDE to compile the code\r\n\r\n======================\r\n Project Contribution\r\n======================\r\n\r\n\r\n the bak-IDE is listed under the GNU GPL v3 license which make it tottaly free-software, if you really want to add to the project be a contributer to our project on github: https://github.com/geekybedouin/Bak-IDE\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
