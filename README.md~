===================
 About the Project
===================

 A free-software minimized educational IDE developed by 'Umar A.Abu Bakr - An-Najah National University | Computer Science student - 2014. Offers a graphical UI implemented in JAVA programming language based on the "Khwarizmi Baby C Compiler" - (kbcc) which is implemented in "x86/GAS Syntax Assembly". The compiler aims to transfer c code into a target machine code/executable program, with a report showing the details of each compiler phase. compatible with GNU/Linux x86 machines.

=================
  System Specs
=================
* JDK (Java Development Kit) 7.51 or higher
* GNU/linux x86 machine
* gcc, g++ and build-utils installed

===================
  How to Install 
===================
* In terminal, grant executing permissions to the configuration file (config) [sudo chmod a+x /absolute/path/to/config]
* Run the config file in terminal [./absolute/path/to/config] 

=================
   How to run 
=================
* if you want to run the Bak GUI
  -in a bash, ksh or csh: /absolute/path/to/java -jar /absolute/path/to/Bak.Jar

* if you want to run the kbcc only
  -in a bash, ksh: lexical /par1/ /par2/ /par3/
      -[par1]: absolute/path/to/source.cpp
      -[par2]: absolute/path/to/temp.c **VERY IMPORTANT** --> this is used as the output of the preprocesser which eleminates comments
      -[par3]: absolute/path/to/symbol-table.cpp

====================
 Source Compilation
====================

* LEXICAL

  the lexical analyser is written in two languages - c & x86/gas Assembly - and then generated all to a utilized gas assembly code through g++, if you want to assemble the code you can type - as /absolute/path/to/lexical.s - in  terminal

* Bak IDE

  use netbeans to compile the code
